List of files included in the email:
	main.cpp
	makefile
	README
	Report.txt

The code is in C++. A make file has been provided, so to compile just run:

	make

This shoudl be done within the directory where the make file and main.cpp
are at. If you wish to output running time as well follow the instructions
detailed in the first comment box of the main.cpp file, following '*NOTE:'
and make sure to compile it on a linux machine due to it using a system call

In order to run the program follow this usage guide bellow

	usage: cluster datafile.txt #_of_clusters kmeans|average

DEPENDENCIES:
	- As it was not required, the program doesn't check for most usage
		errors or errors in the datafile used.
	- To avoid problems, make sure that the datafile can be printed to
		the terminal properly using:
	
		cat datafile.txt

	- Make sure that the files don't contain and duplicate points since,
		even in theory, it would brake the functions when the number
		of data	points equals the number of clusters requested.
